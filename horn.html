    <h1>Horn</h1>
    <p>
      Most of my note taking is just jotting down thoughts in a text file in order to help me think, but sometimes I want to 
      organize important thoughts into a more structured form. Specifically, one that allows me to understand my reasoning
      years later later. Horn is a note taking tool made for that purpose. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Notes in Horn are organized into Horn clauses. Notes can be simple text fragments, or rules that rules that describe 
      how one collection of notes implies another. This allows me to track the arguments for each thought in a format that's
      more flexible than just bullet points.  

      It was built with Rust, Tauri, React, and TypeScript.
